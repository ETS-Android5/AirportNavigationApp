TRP is an android phone application created as a **class project** for the **SE 300 class**. The app is designed to help users navigate large airports. Ticket information, departing flights, maps, and amenity locations in the airport are all easily viewable to the user.

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀• Enter your airport and flight number to see  relevant information to your flight!

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀• View a multi-layered map of your airport with markers indicating special points of interest.

## Supported Airports
Each airport must be manually added into our app. Because of this, only the following airports are supported in Trp at this time:

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀• Daytona Beach International Airport

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀• Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀• Los Angeles International Airport

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀• Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀• Tampa International Airport

We plan to update this list as time goes on and will change the README accordingly. Please see the "Bugs / Questions" tab if you would like us to add a specific airport.

## Download
Currently, there is no direct download for Trp. However, you can download and run our code by installing Visual Studio and Xamarin Forms using this link: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/xamarin/hello-world-tutorial/install (click the download button and follow the tutorial on the first page). Once you have installed Visual Studio with "Mobile development with .NET" you should be able to download and run Trp.

If your android emulator runs slowly or does not open at all, follow the information in this link to hopefully solve your issue:
